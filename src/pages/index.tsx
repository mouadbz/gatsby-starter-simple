      The concept of natural law had no place in Torah.
      Yet Paul – as he struggled to define the law that he believed,
      in the wake of the crucifixion and the resurrection,
      to be written on the heart of all who acknowledged Christ as Lord –
      did not hesitate to adapt the teachings of the Greeks.
      The word he used for it – syneidesis – clearly signalled which philosophers
      in particular he had in mind. Paul, at the heart of his gospel, was enshrining
      the Stoic concept of conscience.
